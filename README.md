# Awesome URL shortener
The idea of this project is to create a polyglot solution to the problem of long and user-unfriendly URLs. For this solution Redis and MongoDB where used to store URLs and stadistics about clicks.
Redis was used as a key-value database (key: short URL, value: long URL), and MongoDB was used to store clicks' information such as date of click, device, etc.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this project, user must have installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation)
    ```
    pip install fastapi
    pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
    ```
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (not mandatory but highly recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)
    ```
    docker pull mongo
    docker run --name Mymongo â€“p 27017:27017 -d mongo
    ```
- [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)
    ```
    docker pull redis
    docker run --name Myredis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
    ```

## Project structure
- api: contains API files
    - mongo: contains MongoDB management files
        - models: contains the schema for the data, representing how it will be stored in Mongo
        - routes: contains the endpoints, and which function each of them will call
        - mongo_connection.py: manages configuration data for connection (host and port), and helper functions
    - red: contains Redis management files
        - routes: contains the endpoints, and which function each of them will call
        - redis_connection.py: manages configuration data for connection (host and port), and helper functions

## Running the project
1. Start Docker
2. Start MongoDB
    ```
    docker start Mymongo
    ```
3. Start Redis
    ```
    docker start Myredis
    ```
4. Start API
    From the main path:
    ```
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
